1	 Introduction
What is Portfolio Website?
A portfolio site is an extension of a freelancer’s or the company’s resume. It provides an appropriate way for potential clients to view their work while also allowing them to expand on their skills and services. However, this isn’t the ultimate purpose of a portfolio website.
The ultimate purpose of portfolio website is to provide a way for them to land more clients, weather that means freelance work, more clients for their agency or employment at a company. They should decide what they want to accomplish with their website before adding content to it (Staff, April 23, 2018).

This is the report on our coursework which was given on 7th week and to be submitted on 12th week. This is the individually assign coursework which is related to develop a portfolio website including five webpages (Home, Blog, Portfolio, Research and Contact). The  main  objective  of  this  coursework  is  to  be  familiar  with  website designing, gain knowledge about HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

1.1	HTML
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It describes the structure of Web pages. HTML consists of the series of the elements HTML elements  are  the  building blocks  of  HTML  pages  where  elements  are  represented  by  tags. HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table",  “footer” and so on. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page (Staff, n.d.)
<!--...--> Defines a comment
<!DOCTYPE> Defines the document type
<html> Defines the root of an HTML document
<a> Defines a hyperlink
<div> Defines a section in a document
<head> Defines information about the document
<body> Defines the document's body
<br> Defines a single line break
<button> Defines a clickable button
<footer> Defines a footer for a document or section
<header> Defines a header for a document or section
(Staff, n.d.)
 


1.2	CSS
CSS refers to Cascading Style Sheets which is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.CSS helps in the handling of the look and feel part of a web page. With the help of CSS, we can control the  color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs, and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects (Staff, n.d.).



1.3	JavaScript
Javascript (JS) is a scripting languages, primarily used on the Web. It is used to enhance HTML pages and is commonly found embedded in HTML code. JavaScript is an interpreted language. Thus, it doesn't need to be compiled. JavaScript renders web pages in an interactive and dynamic fashion. This allowing the pages to react to events, exhibit special effects, accept variable text, validate data, create cookies, detect a user’s browser, etc. (Staff, Agust 8,2014).









2	Discussion and Analysis
For the completion of this project a lot of discussion and analysis was done. I was not clear about some tags of the HTML so a help with the module leader and friends was taken. At the end I had completed a project. For the completion of this project an application HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript is used. 

To complete this coursework, different tools have been used to make our work more easy and accurate such as:
•	MS-Word
•	Draw.io
•	Atom
•	Balsamiq Mockups 3
